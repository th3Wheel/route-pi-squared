## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Two Linux systems (VMs, containers, or bare metal)
- Pi-hole installed on both systems
- Git for version control

### Testing Changes

1. **Configuration Changes:**
   - Test on both master and backup nodes
   - Verify failover works correctly
   - Check logs for any errors

2. **Script Changes:**

   - Verify exit codes are correct
   - Test edge cases (service down, network issues)

3. **Documentation Changes:**
   - Ensure markdown is properly formatted
   - Verify all links work
   - Check that examples are accurate

### Documentation Standards

- Use clear, concise language
